This project implements an econometric analysis using the Ordinary Least Squares (OLS) regression model to examine how Amazon’s daily stock returns are influenced by broader market movements represented by the NASDAQ Composite and S&P 500 indices over a ten-year period (2014–2024). The study applies statistical modeling, hypothesis testing, and diagnostic validation to evaluate the strength, direction, and significance of these relationships.

The analysis includes data collection from Refinitiv DataStream, transformation of prices into logarithmic returns, handling of missing values and outliers, descriptive statistics, correlation analysis, regression estimation in EViews, and validation of OLS assumptions such as multicollinearity, homoskedasticity, serial correlation, and normality of residuals. The findings indicate that Amazon’s returns are strongly influenced by technology-sector dynamics captured by NASDAQ and, to a lesser extent, by broader market conditions represented by the S&P 500, with a high explanatory power supporting the robustness of the model.
